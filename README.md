# ðŸ©º PneumoDetect AI

**Web Service for Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays Using Deep Learning and Large Language Models for Result Interpretation**

---

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

This project is developed as part of my bachelor thesis. The goal is to build a full-stack web application deployed on a live server and accessible via a custom domain.

Users can upload chest X-ray images, and the system performs two core tasks:

1. **Detect pneumonia** using a deep learning model (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).
2. **Generate a textual medical report** using an LLM (e.g., GPT-4 via OpenAI API).

The system is containerized and fully automated using DevOps practices, enabling real-time diagnostics in a production-ready environment.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Strategy

- **Branching Strategy**:
  - `master` â†’ production branch
  - `feature/*` â†’ feature development
- **CI/CD**:
  - PRs and pushes to `master` trigger:
    - Linting
    - Build
    - Deployment

> Built with production-first principles in mind using containerized services and automated pipelines.
